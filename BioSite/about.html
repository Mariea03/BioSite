      <p class="white-bg">Andy grew up as a middle child with an older brother and a younger sister. School was not one of Andyâ€™s favorite places. He enjoyed working with his hands and building anything. As a child Andy spent a lot of time with his grandfather building race cars and going to the track. He learned a lot about muscle cars working with his grandfather and at one point was racing the car his father had built at his age. That quickly ended when he met Marissa.
      Andy met his wife in high school. They were inseparable from the moment they met. They started their family and their life together early, both knowing that is where they wanted to be.</p>
      <p class="black-bg" > Once their second son Levi was born, they decided that they wanted to raise their family with family around them and started the idea of a family compound. Everything is on the table including relocating to meet the needs of what everyone wants.
      Andy works for an iron foundry as a mechanical maintenance technician. He is very smart when it comes to fixing machines and takes great pride in teaching others how to fix them as well. Andy has learned a few trades prior to the one he is in now. He spent some time with his dad as junior apprentice Mason. He has also spent a couple of years as a seamer technician for canning companies. Andy enjoys working with his hands and loves to build machines. </p>
