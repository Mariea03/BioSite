    <p>Andy has many hobbies. Fishing is something he has enjoyed since he was a kid. He went to a fly-fishing camp every spring. There he learned how to fly fish, make nets, rods, and a knife. His great-grandfather served as president and several uncles served underneath at various other positions. All investing time teaching youth how to fish. Andy hopes to continue this teaching with his boys. </p>
    <p>Andy also is teaching himself investing. He is learning how to buy, sell, and trade stocks and has had his first successful year of growth. Andy is very interested in making his money to do the work, so he does not have to. </p>
    <p>Andy's favorite hobby is family time where you will often hear put your phone down itâ€™s family time. This can be anything for Andy. As long as we are in a group collectively engaged with one another you can bet we are in family time and the focus is on one another.  </p>
